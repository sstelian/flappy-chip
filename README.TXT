Flappy Chip is a Flappy Bird-like game written for the Arduino Uno. It uses one
button as input and a Nokia 3310 display. It also stores the highscore in EEPROM.

I wrote this when I was in highschool because I thought it was a fun way to
improve my programming skills. At this point I'm so ashamed by this code, but
back then it took my programming skills to the next level.

The graphical elements were drawn in MS Paint as monochrome bitmaps. I then
converted them to byte arrays which are stored in Flash as constants, which does
the trick for the staggering 84x48 resolution with 1 bit color depth.

Excuse my messy code. It just works.
